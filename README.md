# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is about creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. I was given initial HTML and CSS files, so I am working on the Javascript code. This app shall comply with the following requirements:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page.

I am using the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Also this app is powered by [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/).

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://github.com/mchinojo/7Work-Day-Scheduler

## Usage

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
